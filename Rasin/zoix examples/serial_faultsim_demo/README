Purpose
-------

	To check serial fault simulation flow for VC-Z01X where a set of Illegal Group Faults (IA,IF) from the concurrent simulation are fed back to serial fault simulation

FLOW
----

	VC-Z01X : make run_vc_zoix

		>> Compile through VCS 
		>> Fault generation through vc_fcc (through fcm.tcl)
		>> Fault simulation in Concurrent mode
		>> Selection of IA faults from first simulation
		>> Fault simulation of IA faults in Serial mode
		>> Generation of report using final fault statuses

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
-------------------
		
		>>	Makefile	:	contains all run commands for both tools
		
		>>	README		: 	guide to demo

		>>	test.v		:	source file

		>>  in.sff		:	sff file

Notes
-----
	A suitable version of VERDI should be used to run
