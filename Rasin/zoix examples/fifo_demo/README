Purpose
-------

	1. To check fault simulation flow for both VC-Z01X (multi-user FDB mode) and Z01X in which PERMANENT PORT faults are simulated

	2. To dump fsdb for fault machine through
			>> 	fcm.tcl approach
			>>	VERDI approach

FLOW
----

	VC-Z01X : make run_vc_zoix
		>> Compile through VCS 
		>> Fault generation through vc_fcc (inside fcm.tcl)
		>> Fault simulation and fm fsdb dumping for a selected single fault (Fault ID:130 in this case)
		>> Coverage report generation through vc_fcm

	Z01X : make run_zoix
		>> Compile through Z01X
		>> Fault generation through fr2fdef (inside user.fmsh)
		>> Fault simulation and Coverage report generation through fmsh in fdef flow

	VC-Z01X (FM Dumping through VERDI) : make run_vc_fmdump 
		>> Compile through VCS 
		>> Fault generation and simulation (through fcm.tcl)
		>> Open VERDI and dump waveform (steps explained under COLLATERAL/VERDI/dumping_note) 


DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
-------------------
		
		>>	Makefile	:	contains all run commands for both tools

Notes
-----
	A suitable version of VERDI should be used to run
